# QtRobo
QtRobo is an application to dynamically create control panels to interact with microcontrollers or development boards like Arduino 
via serial port on a desktop computer. The project was inspired by the mobile plattform application RoboRemo. 

## Prequisites 
As the project relies on the QT framework it is necessary to have it installed. Additionally the following QT5 libraries also have to be installed: 

* QT5 Serial Port 
* QT5 Quickcontrols 2

The compilation should be straight forward as the project utilizes the standard qmake build for QT applications.
